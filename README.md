# Canada GHG Emissions Projections — Policy Scenarios, Sectors & Provinces (ECCC)

Interactive dashboard built with **Python, Plotly, and Streamlit** using open datasets from **Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)**.

## 🔎 Key Questions Answered
- How do national emissions evolve under the Reference vs Additional Measures scenarios?
- Which sectors contribute most to future emissions, and how does this change over time?
- What is the expected emissions difference (Additional Measures − Reference) by sector across years?
- Which provinces are projected to emit the most in 2030 under the Reference scenario?
