<h1>Advanced Canada GHG Emissions Dashboard</h1>
<p>This interactive dashboard integrates <b>detailed provincial-sectoral projections</b> with <b>national scenario summaries</b> from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Compare</b> "Reference" vs "Additional Measures" across years, provinces, and sectors.</li>
<li><b>Explore</b> scenario deltas (differences) and national trends.</li>
<li><b>Filter</b> using dropdowns or sliders in each chart.</li>
</ul>
